The best part: Call center agents at DialAmerica don’t read scripts. Instead, they learn active listening skills for establishing rapport with customers. These sales skills help them use personalized and persuasive techniques.
By adding a human touch to these calls, customers are much more engaged than they would be from listening to a script.

B2C telemarketing is one of the many specialty services offered at Squeeze Media. With a mix of inbound and outbound calling, the Squeeze Media agents can sell your products and services.

They don’t close the leads themselves. Instead, they qualify those leads and set appointments for you. So your sales team will still need to make the sale, but Callbox makes it easier for them by providing qualified leads with confirmed appointments.
Callbox also provides services for things like account-based marketing, customer profiling databases, and event marketing.

Sms Marketing:
Email open rates continue to decline, and the response rate to phone calls is below 6%. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the 98% open rates of text messages helps realtors to:
Keep in front of clients
Improve response rates
Generate more leads
Quickly find buyers
What’s even more important is that the vast majority of people want you to text them: a National Association of Realtors report found that 62% of all home buyers prefer their agent to send property info via text message.

The good news is that only 5% of realtors currently communicate by text, so it’s an opportunity to delight customers and stand out from the crowd.

Our agents have been specialzed in Batchleads, mailchimp, Propstream, Mojo and Reisift etc.
